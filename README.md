## **VoyagerNX**
A port of Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force Holomatch for the Nintendo Switch. Compatible with both controllers and keyboard + mouse controls! Based off of Tulip Voyager (a fork of the Lilium Voyager ioquake3 engine).

## **Installation**
- Latest full build including game files can be downloaded and copied from <a href="https://accela.design/downloads/VoyagerNX.zip">here!<br/></a>
- Copy release files to /switch/ folder
- If providing your own baseoa files, copy baseEF from a copy of Holomatch, making sure not to replace any files.
- Launch via HBMenu (by pressing R, not album!)
- Set phasers to frag!

## **Bugs**
- Sleep mode causes the game and sometimes Horizon to crash. No idea what's causing this yet.
- A small amount of slowdown can happen during really hectic battles in larger maps. This mostly occurs in custom maps and happens regardless of graphical settings (although dropping the resolution may help).
- If you switch between controller and keyboard + mouse input mid-match, your camera may start spinning wildly. Just press ESC/+, click with your desired input, then press ESC/+ again and it should resolve it. This might not even be a real bug and might just be my wireless keyboard, but I'm putting it here just to be safe.

**Lilium Voyager** is a fork of **Lilium Voyager** is a fork of [ioquake3](https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3) for running _Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force Holomatch_ (multiplayer). It is based on Thilo Schulz' [ioEF engine](http://thilo.tjps.eu/efport-progress/) (also known as iostvoyHM). The focus for Lilium Voyager is to maintain Elite Force multiplayer support on newer ioquake3 versions.


Differences from ioEF 1.38-rc1 (2011):

  * Player origin rounding is compatible with the original QVMs (x86, x86_64).
  * Fixed "read past end of server message" error after downloading a pk3 using EF 1.2 protocol (24).
  * Network compatible with ioEF 1.37.
  * Dedicated servers are listed on official Raven master server.
  * Client and server use separate config files (from ioq3).
  * Better compatibility with newer operating systems (from ioq3).
  * VoIP uses Opus codec instead of Speex (from ioq3).
  * Support for ioquake3's OpenGL2 renderer.

Lilium Voyager code commits: [compare/upstream...master](https://github.com/zturtleman/lilium-voyager/compare/upstream...master)

The source code for the Elite Force game, cgame, and ui code is not included as it remains under a non-free license.

## Installation
- Latest full build including game files can be downloaded and copied from <a href="https://accela.design/downloads/VoyagerNX.zip">here!<br/></a>
- Copy to /switch/ folder on your SD card, along with the baseEF folder from Holomatch if you're providing your own baseEF files. **Do not overwrite any files!**
- Launch via regular HBMenu (NOT Applet mode!)

## Bugs
- Sleep mode crashes the game and sometimes Atmosphere. This has been reported in other ioquake3 ports on the Switch (ie; iortcw), so I'm not sure where to begin diagnosing the issue. 
- Solo Match leads to a softlock at the end of every match. This can be worked around by using "Multi Match" to create a bot match instead. If you end up softlocked, you can close the game by pressing Down to open a terminal, pressing L to bring up a virtual keyboard, typing "/quit", pressing Return, then pressing Enter twice, which should get you back to HBMenu.

## Compiling

Lilium Voyager is compiled using `make`. For details see [building ioquake3](http://wiki.ioquake3.org/Building_ioquake3) and the [ioquake3 readme](README-ioq3.md).

The Visual Studio project files are not supported.

Additional make variables not in ioquake3:
* `USE_CODEC_MP3=1` - Enable MP3 support using libmad (defaults to 1).

## TODO

- Add gyroscope support (the gyroscope controls from ioquake3-nx seem to throw tons of errors when attempting to compile them).
